            <h3 id="header2">Javascript Basics</h3>
            <p id= "maintext">JavaScript is a cross-platform,object-orientated scripting 
                language. JavaScript is extremly popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language
                allowing maximum flexability for developers to take it in a bunch of of different directions.
                Javascript lives inside a hose environment (a web broweser or a Node server), it can be a connected 
                to the objects of these enviornments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="bullet"><span>Variable Declarations</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data 
                    values - iamgine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a Variable
                    holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
                    These unique names are called identifiers. <span2>var x;</span2></li>
                <li class="bullet"><span>Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our 
                    cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = Assignmen
                    operator assigs a value to a variable . <span2>var x = 10;</span2></li>
                <li class="bullet"><span>Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need 
                    to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - 
                    <span2>true</span2> or <span2>false;</span2> null- <span2>null</span2> aka nothing. Number - <span2>42</span2> or <span2>3.14159;</span2> String - <span2>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span2>
                    Array - <span2>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span2> and Object - <span2>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span2></li>
                <li class="bullet"><span>Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisionsp hitting different 
                    code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to 
                    accomplish this. There are the followig conditional statments: <span2>if</span2> a specified condition is true, do this code in our
                    code block; <span2>else if</span2> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span2>else</span2> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li class="bullet"><span>Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in ever programming language, but they all essentialy do the same thing:
                    they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track
                    four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                <li class="bullet"><span>Function</span> Functions are and encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. 
                    Think of it as a kist of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the
                    instructions manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next er place the table the right way up.
                    Done! We finishe our instructions. Sadley there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over and 
                    over again.</li>
